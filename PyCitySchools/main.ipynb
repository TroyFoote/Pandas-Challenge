    "The above data breaks down PyCity Schools into two main areas. Firstly the entire Local Government area and secondly the comparison of each school within the area, with a focus given to school budgets along with maths and reading results.\n",
    "There are 15 schools within the Local Government area with a total of 39,170 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following conclusions can be made from the above \n",
    "1. 3 of the top 5 performing schools (% overall passing) are Independent schools. Griffin High School ranks as the best performing school (81.3%) despite having the 3rd lowest student population (917,500).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 4 of the bottom 5 performing schools (% overall passing) are Government schools. Hernandez High School ranks as the worst performing school (66.3%) despite having the 3rd highest student population (3,022,020).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary a higher school population would seemingly result in a lower overall paasing % when combining Maths and Reading scores. When comparing Griffin and Hernandez High Schools, Hernandez spends an extra $27.00 per student (Hernandez $652, Griffin $625) which results in a 15% worse overall passing rate when combining Maths and Reading scores. (Hernandez 66.3, Griffin 81.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Both Math scores and Reading scores across all schools are relatively even through Year levels 9 - 12 ranging between high 60s(%) and low 70s(%) for both Maths and Reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Looking into the Spending Ranges (Per Student) it would seem that the higher ranges lack the results of the lower ranges. Lower ranges seem to out perform the higher ranges across Maths, Reading and Overall %. The average Maths and Reading scores are closer but the $630,000 and below ranges still show to have better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The same can be said for smaller schools (student population). These also outperform the medium and larger sized schools in all result areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. As noted in points 1. and 2. Independent schools achieve higher average scores across all selected fields.\n",
